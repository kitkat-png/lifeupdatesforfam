            <p>Hello, I'm a creature who loves things like cardboard boxes that are big enough to hide in, cats, front end web development, drawing, writing, and my favorite shows. My favorite shows are My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and The Owl House, in case ya wanted to know.</p>

            <p>Go to my <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@smallkit">pronouns.page</a> to learn some other things about me. It contains some essential info about things like the pronouns I go by and the terms I prefer to name a few examples. It also contains more useful stuff like how to use those pronouns when talking and definitions of certain terms. And <a href="https://cara.app/microscopic-creature">here's a link to my art account on cara</a> if ya wanna see some art I made.</p>

                    <h3>Things I'm Thankful For</h3>
                    <p class="date">Sunday April 6th, 2025</p>

                    <p>My mental health has been in the gutter lately so here's a list of things I've been thankful for:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>My ability to read and write</li>
                        <li>The existence of stuff to read (like fanfiction to name one example)</li>
                        <li>Drawing (though I haven't been practicing as much as I should)</li>
                        <li>My ability to make my own websites (I don't need any of those dumb website makers)</li>
                        <li>The potential of a future that's more bearable.</li>
                        <li>The fact that since I'm over eighteen I'm no longer legally considered property</li>
                        <li>That moment when I finally have some energy after so long of feeling exhausted</li>
                        <li>My cats</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Some things I wanna do</h3>
                    <p class="date">Tuesday March 18th, 2025 - 12:43 PM</p>

                    <p>A few things I really wanna do is that I wanna get better at writing and I wanna learn how to bake. I've always wanted to be a good writer and baking is awesome because if you bake your own stuff you don't have to add the stuff you don't like.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>First post!</h3>
                    <p class="date">Monday March 17th, 2025 - 3:25 PM</p>

                    <p>Hello! This is my first life update post. Recently I've just been trying to keep my head above water. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do. I was thinking I'd go to school for web development after I get my GED cuz I'm interested in that but I'm also kinda nervous about it.</p>

        <section id="more-info">
            <h2>More Info About This Site</h2>

            <p>This website is made with my own two hands using HTML and CSS. It's also hosted for free using Github Pages. <a href="https://github.com/kitkat-png/lifeupdatesforfam">Here</a> is the link to this website's Github page. This website currently looks best on larger screens.</p>

            <p>When I got banned from Facebook it was for something related to identity. (I can't remember their exact phrasing) I honestly suspect that it was partially due to the fact that I changed my name a while back, but whatever. Anyway, Facebook is annoying anyway and I didn't have much reason to be on there, so I made this website to replace one of the only reasons I was on there.</p>

            <p>Also, I wanted to make it so each section would have a cloud as its background image but I can't figure out a way to do that without having to resize it every time I add more text which would be annoying. If ya got any advice when it comes to that let me know. Also the background image on the header text doesn't look good on a bunch of screen sizes and I dunno how to fix that.</p>

            <h2>Credits</h2>
            <p>A credits page for me to give credit where credit is due.</p>

                <li><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css">This article</a> keeps helping me remember how to center a div.</li>
                <li><a><a href="https://www.heyfonts.com/display/kitto-cute-free-font/">This</a> is the font used for the first header text. It was made by Helotype and the font is called Kitto Katto.</li>
                <li>The favicon is some random silly cat picture that I'm not sure of the origin of.</li>
